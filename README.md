# 2022-Romi
Simple code for the Romi miniature robot, derived from 997's competition Java code for the 2022 Rapid React season.

Intended for use with path following testing, training new members, and demonstrations to the public (recruitment!). Another possible application is drive team practice with a handful of identical robots.

Planned to include several branches, ranging from barely-a-skeleton to fully-featured-with-configurable-values, to support team members of all stages of learning Java in the application of FRC, as they fill in the pieces.

Current Issues:
    I have no idea how to select an auto mode in the sim (may just have to hardcode).
    Odometry is messed up.
